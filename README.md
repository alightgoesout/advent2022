# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for [the 2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

To run a puzzle, simply execute the program with the day number as a parameter.
For instance, to run the puzzle for the first day, run:

```shell
❯ cargo run 1
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/advent2022 1`
1:1 — Maximum calories held by one Elf: 68467
1:2 — Sum of top three calories held by Elves: 203420
Done in 7ms
